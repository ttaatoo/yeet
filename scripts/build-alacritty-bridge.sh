# Builds the Rust static library behind Kero's Alacritty backend and stages a
# single archive at a stable path for the linker.
#
# Xcode runs this as a build phase ahead of Compile Sources. It builds one
# slice per architecture in $ARCHS and lipos them together, so a universal
# release build gets a universal archive.
#
# ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING is on for this project, so a script phase may
# write only to its declared outputs and to TARGET_TEMP_DIR — not to SRCROOT,
# and not to DERIVED_FILE_DIR. Cargo opens Cargo.lock for write even under
# --locked, so the crate is copied into TARGET_TEMP_DIR and built from the
# copy; SRCROOT is only ever read.
